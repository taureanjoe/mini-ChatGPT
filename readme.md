# Chatbot using OpenAI's GPT-3

This project is a simple chatbot built using Python and OpenAI's GPT-3 language model. It allows users to have a conversation with the chatbot by typing in their messages, and the chatbot responds with a message generated by GPT-3.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3
* An API key from OpenAI (https://beta.openai.com/)


## Installation
1. Install the required packages:

`pip install openai`

2. Clone this repository

`git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot-gpt3.git
cd chatbot-gpt3`

3. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` in `chatbot.py` with your actual API key from OpenAI.

## Usage

Run the chatbot using the following command:

`python chatbot.py`

You can then type in your messages to the chatbot and press enter to see the chatbot's response. To exit the chatbot, type `*exit*` and press enter.

## Customization

The chatbot's behavior can be customized by adjusting the parameters passed to the GPT-3 model in *`chatbot.py`*, such as the `temperature` and the `max_tokens`. You can also change the GPT-3 engine used by setting the `engine` parameter.
